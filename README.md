# Cosmos - Creative Optimization System for Modular Output Generation

Cosmos is a flexible and versatile framework inspired by Blender's Geometry Nodes. It provides a node-based system for procedural generation and manipulation of 3D geometry. With Cosmos, developers can create complex procedural workflows to generate, modify, and animate geometry in a visual and intuitive manner. It empowers artists and developers to create dynamic and customizable assets, simulations, and effects with ease.

## ToDo:

[ ] Exposed Parameters
[ ] Custom Inspector
[ ] Accept Scene Objects Somehow (Graph is not scene asset)
[ ] Add Nodes Similar To Blender Geometry Nodes
[ ] Runtime Graph Processing (Completely Procedural Scenes)
[ ] Procedural mesh creation

### Nodes (GO is game object):

[ ] Input Nodes (bool, float, vector, material, GO, etc.)
[ ] Output Nodes (mesh out, material out, transform out)
[ ] Join Nodes (join meshes, join strings)
[ ] Procedural Textures (noise, voronoi, checker, etc.)
[ ] Distribute Points on Face
[ ] Material Nodes (Set Material, Set Pass)
[ ] Transform Node
[ ] Instance Nodes
[ ] Math Nodes
[ ] Debug Nodes

## Under Consideration:

[ ] Volume Nodes
[ ] SDFs (Signed Distance Fields)
